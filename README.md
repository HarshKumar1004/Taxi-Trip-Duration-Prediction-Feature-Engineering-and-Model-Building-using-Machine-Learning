# Taxi-Trip-Duration-Prediction-Feature-Engineering-and-Model-Building-using-Machine-Learning
To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request. Here we build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City.
